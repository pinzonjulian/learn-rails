##learn-rails
This is a practice repository for the app on the book *Learn Ruby on Rails* by *Michael Kahoe*

Feel free to check it out and ask questions if you're working through the book.

### Configuration
By the time this tutorial was followed, Rails 5.0 had come out but the book hadn't been updated so I'm using an older version of rails and ruby:
*Ruby 2.2.2
*Rails 4.3.7
